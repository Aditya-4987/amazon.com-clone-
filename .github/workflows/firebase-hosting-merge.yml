      # Step 1: Set up Node.js environment
      # This makes sure you have Node.js available to run npm and your build script
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 'lts/*' # Or specify a version like '18.x' or '20.x' if your project needs it

      # Step 2: Install dependencies
      # This is crucial! It installs react-scripts and all other dependencies needed for the build
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci # 'npm ci' is recommended in CI environments for speed and reliability

      # --- NEW STEPS END HERE ---

      # Existing step: Run the build script
      # This will now work because dependencies are installed
      - run: npm run build
